And he was a preacher. There were some 200+ people in the room by my estimates, and we were all transfixed by the sheer simplicity of what he said. Now, as a background, I have recently finished reading the Four Hour Work Week - a book that encourages us to throw off the shackles of employment and set up our own businesses using the interweb that we can manage virtually from a beach with a margarita in one hand and a fishing rod in the other. And this presentation spoke very well to the idea of setting up a fully operational e-commerce business in as little as three clicks. The preacher raved and intoned and gesticulated in a very animated way. He told the story of the internet, and above small print that told us that the stories were not typical of the results of people using the system, told us fantastic stories of people selling things on the internet.
