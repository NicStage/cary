So I was understandably excited about the prospect of a seminar with free food, good company and an imitation iPod Shuffle. I wanted to see how it was done old school. If I graduated from this seminar without buying something, maybe I could progress onto the time-share seminar and from thence onto buying a used car from a dealership...

I couldn't believe the scope of the seminar. Signing in as Mister Gillespie, so as to protect the innocent and their personal privacy, I studiously avoided everyone's eyes. Much as everyone else was doing. It was like that corridor where you wait to give sperm samples for money. No-one acknowledges that anyone else exists. If I can't see them, they can't see me, and besides, I'm not here anyway.
